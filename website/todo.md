# To DO
## baseline

- search by thread reply text
- admin remove thread reply
- add admin diable button on profile page

## minimum functional requirements
- change to 2 column layout ? (I don't think she cares)
- add automatic updates for when other users post
- make sure error pages look decent

## additional
- hot threads
- admin usage stats / charts
- ~~sort threads by last post not creation~~
- reply quotes - could make colapseable
